## Supporting ScalaPB development

Love ScalaPB? Want to show your support for its continued maintenance?
[Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/thesamet)!

## Asking questions

If you have a question about using ScalaPB you are welcome to contact
us over [ScalaPB Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ScalaPB/community).

If you prefer email or less-interactive contact, you can post to [ScalaPB's
Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/scalapb).

If you believe the question (or its answer) might be beneficial to many users
consider posting it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and tag it
with `scalapb`. @thesamet (the main author) gets notified when that happen.

If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please
[search our open Github issues](https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB/issues),
and if it is a new bug feel free to post a new issue. When posting a new
issue, please describe what are you trying to do, what you expect it to do,
and what unexpected things happen. Provide as much detail as possible and
include all relevant code so it is possible for us to reproduce the issue.

## Providing minimal reproducible example

Depending on the case, you may be asked to provide a minimal reproducible
example that demonstrates the issue. This means that the maintainers are
unable to tell what is going on without additional context. To save time, the
additional context provided need to be kept to a minimum. To accomplish that,
provide a small sbt project that includes only the relevant plugins and
settings, and the minimal code, minimal amount of proto files, messages and
field that are needed to demonstrate the problem. Include instructions on how
to run the project so the problem can be exhibited. This makes it much easier
for a maintainers to identify a bug and propose a solution or a workaround.

You can use the ScalaPB sbt template to quickly generate a minimal project:

```
sbt new scalapb/scalapb-template.g8
```

## I need urgent support! When can I have a feature ready?

If you need an issue resolved or a feature developed for you in a timely
manner, consider reaching out over email (thesamet at gmail.com) to discuss
payment options for this project work (small projects start at $200 USD).  This
would be a great way to support the time and effort put into the development of
ScalaPB!
