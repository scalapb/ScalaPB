## Supporting ScalaPB development

Love ScalaPB? Want to show your support for its continued maintenance?
[Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/thesamet)!

## Asking questions

If you have a question about using ScalaPB you are welcome to contact
us over [ScalaPB Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/ScalaPB/community).

If you prefer email or less-interactive contact, you can post to [ScalaPB's
Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/scalapb).

If you believe the question (or its answer) might be beneficial to many users
consider posting it on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) and tag it
with `scalapb`. @thesamet (the main author) gets notified when that happen.

If you have found a bug or have a feature request, please
[search our open Github issues](https://github.com/scalapb/ScalaPB/issues),
and if it is a new bug feel free to post a new issue. When posting a new
issue, please describe what are you trying to do, what you expect it to do,
and what unexpected things happen. Provide as much detail as possible and
include all relevant code so it is possible for us to reproduce the issue.

## Providing minimal reproducible example

Depending on the case, you may be asked to provide a minimal reproducible example
that demonstrates the issue. This means that the maintainer is unable to tell
what is going on without additional context. At the same time, to save time, the additional
context provided need to be kept to a minimum. To accomplish that, provide a
small sbt project that includes only the relevant plugins and settings, and
the minimal code, minimal amount of proto files, messages and field that are
needed to demonstrate the problem. Include instructions on how to run the
project so the problem can be exhibited. This makes it much easier for a
maintainer to identify a bug and propose a solution or a workaround.

You can use the ScalaPB sbt template to quickly generate a minimal project:

```
sbt new scalapb/scalapb-template.g8
```

## I need urgent support! When can I have a feature ready?

If you need an issue resolved or a feature developed for you in a timely
manner, consider reaching out over email (thesamet at gmail.com) to discuss
payment options for this project work (small projects start at $200 USD).  This
would be a great way to support the time and effort put into the development of
ScalaPB!
